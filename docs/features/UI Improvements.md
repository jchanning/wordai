**UI Improvements**



**Browser**

1. **Notification Panel**

There is a notification panel located in the in the top menu that appears and disappears. This needs to be moved to a better location that:

1. Does not have any side effects on the screen lay out when it appears and disappears
2. It always visible.



**2. Improvements to Button colours, size and position**

a. The Game related buttons need to be connected to the game panel, not the top menu

b. The colours needs to be sorted out and made more consistent

c. "Make Guess" should be renamed "Guess"

d. "Get Suggestion" should be renamed "Assist"



3\. **Game Analytics should be renamed Assistant**



**4. Dictionary Improvements**

a. Dictionary labels needs to reflect actual difficulty, 4 letters is hardest, 7 letters is easiest

b. The algorithm to calculate difficulty needs to be reassessed and aligned with the words that the algorithms in autoplay fail on most often.





5\. **Visual Improvement**

a. Make font sizes and type consistent across the whole app





6\. **Roles**

Add different roles:

* Player - an unregistered player who has access to limited features
* Registered Player - a registered player who has access to some of the more advanced features
* Premium Player - a registered subscriber who has access to all player features
* Administrator - a role limited to technical users providing access to administrative features



7\. **Admin**

**a**) The Admin screen should only be displayed on the menu when the user who has logged is is an administrator

b) The show sessions should show a table with details about each open session including browser type, IP address, etc. if possible





8\. Panels

a) The background panels should remain a fixed size and accommodate all the content that needs to be displayed. They should not resize as more guesses are made in a game, for example.



**9. Mobile**

a) The game input grid needs to be larger and fill more of the screen. It needs to be more like Wordle which is clean and clear.

b) It needs to work well on iPhone and Android and on all phone screen sizes.

c) The keyboard needs to be appear only when required on mobile devices.

d) When auto playing games, the keyboard should appear as it is not used.
