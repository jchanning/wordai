UI Issues

**Browser**

Notification panel that appears and disappears in the top menu - move the feedback box somewhere else

Button colours, size and position - Game related buttons need to be connected to the game

Game Analytics -> Assistant

Dictionary labelling needs to reflect actual difficulty 4 letters is hardest!

Make Guess -> Guess

Get Suggestion -> Suggest





Organise this better and make font sizes etc consistent...

Total Letters By Position -> 

Letters by Position ->

Most Common Letters ->





Letters by Position is the same as the Dictionary page without the sorting



Session Stats is full width as the browser window is made smaller



The background panel should not resize as the content changes







**Mobile**

The grid needs to be larger - similar to Wordle

The keyboard needs to be appear only when required. It should not display in auto mode.





**Performance**

Do not work in the cloud as too inefficient:

Minimise Column Lengths

Maximise Entropy



**Algorithms**

Reclassify algorithms (Random, Random optimised, Entropy, Entropy++) and document
